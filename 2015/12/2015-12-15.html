<p>back to stackedit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so sad to accept the truth that I have remove the dairy and articles wrote with stackedit and saved in localStorage personally == ,for which I decide not to use stackedit for a while ..</p>
<p>but now I am back , back to the familliar corner , and think I should not leave the absurd fault on a brilliant online edit tool ^^</p>

<p>if we got strongest willing , the whole world will make way for you.</p>

<p>today I talked with an old friend on the wechat using voice, to my surprise he has been a little fed up with the work that he did every day and was seek for another kind of lifestyle , and I asked why , he told me that when he was study at school,  the teacher told the classmates that they&#39;ve got a bright prospect , and the business of this industry is ok, but when he really join the real job as a intern , he has a strong feeling of been tricked , because of the head in different time, he feel awful.</p>
<p>there is no any good if I was he. to be honest I&#39;ve encountered the same feeling when I was a fresh man in university , and it seems like when you have done what ever your effort and then you have been sentenced to failed cruelly , just because in the past you are a innocent guy. </p>
<p>after been loss and puzzled,I decide to find my own way.
and from then on I begin to realize something: if the surroundings which you ever expect to rely on didn&#39;t give the accurate guidance to you，that &#39;s ok ,because they are not exist for you , they just should have to point you the right way but if they not, they didn&#39;t sustain a big loss, the thing is you , you are all you&#39;ve loss . so don&#39;t hesitate, if you already have the impulsion to live what kind of life , just take it into action, go for it , enjoy the precess of pursuing. 
we are not alike with our parents generation , for some tough time they just live for survive and took a lot tiny things into consideration, for us most of it just simplified to like something or dislike , so be brave ! that&#39;s not that difficult when you really hold the ambition and wanna to achieve something.</p>
<p>aha, at the end of this chicken soup，still got the change to apologize to some guy for the stupid mistake I&#39;ve made recently,
sorry I am not really want to change the attitude and manners toward you , for me it&#39;s a must , and I think it&#39;s a proper decision, trust me.</p>
