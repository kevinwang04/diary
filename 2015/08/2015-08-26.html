<blockquote>
<p>&quot;you know nothing Jon Snow&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Ygritte say those words,I guese she was hurt inside.</p>
<p>The wild and the crow.</p>
<p>The opponent and the comarde-in-arms. </p>
<p>The dalit and the bastard.</p>
<p>The man and woman who suffered unfair of the fate.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1s9Ypc1.png" alt="you know nothing"></p>
<p>she is so brave .brave to go back on the commander, brave to show her AEE, brave to abandon everything and follow the lover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;why don&#39;t you kill me？&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot kill a woman .&quot;</p>

<p>“I know I want you,&quot; he heard himself say, all his vows and his honor all forgotten. She stood before him naked as her name day, and he was as hard as the rock around them. He had been in her half a hundred times by now, but always beneath furs, with others all around them. He had never seeen how beautiful she was. Her legs were skinny and well muscled, the hair at the juncture of her thighs a brighter red than that on her head. Does that make it even luckier? He pulled her close. </p>
<p>&quot;I love the smell of you,&quot; he said. &quot;I love your red hair. I love your mouth, and the way you kiss me. I love your smile. I love your teats.&quot; He kissed them, one and then the other. &quot;I love your skinny legs, and what&#39;s between them.&quot; He knelt to kiss her there, lightly on her mound at first, but Ygritte moved her legs apart a little, and he saw the pink inside and kissed that as well, and tasted her. </p>
<p>She gave a little gasp. &quot;If you love me all so much, why are you still dressed?&quot; she whispered. &quot;You know nothing, Jon Snow. Noth---oh. Oh. OHHH.&quot;</p>
<p>Afterward, she was almost shy, or as shy as Ygritte ever got. &quot;The thing you did,&quot; she said, when they lay together on their piled clothes. &quot;With your...mouth.&quot; She hesistated. &quot;Is that...is it what lordss do to their ladies, down in the south?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies. &quot;I only...wanted to kiss you there, that&#39;s all. You seemed to like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye. I...I liked it some. No one taught you such?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s been no one,&quot; he confessed. &quot;Only you.” </p>

<p>&quot;The Night&#39;s Watch is kind of crazy with those oaths. If they didn&#39;t have to forswear just about everything any normal man would in Westeros would want, they would have more people up there defending the wall. I keep wondering if Jon is going to be stuck with them and those oaths forever. I also wonder when, if ever, we&#39;ll be seeing a Stark family reunion. It would be especially nice if jon and Arya could meet again, since they think about each other so much. &quot;
